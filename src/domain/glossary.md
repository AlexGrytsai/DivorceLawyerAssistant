# 📘 Domain Glossary

A glossary of core domain terms used across the system.

### 📄 **Document**

A discrete unit of information that contains structured or unstructured data
(e.g., text, images, or tables) and can be stored, retrieved, and processed
within the system.

---

### 📁 **Folder**

A logical container used to group and organize documents or related entities
for easier navigation and management.

---

### 🗂 **Category**

A primary classification within a Root Section that divides content into
distinct topics or themes. Categories help structure information by subject,
but they are optional — a Root Section may contain documents and folders
directly without any categories.

---

### 📂 **Workspace**

A top-level organizational unit representing a major topic, department,
or domain area. It can contain categories, folders, or documents directly
and serves as the entry point for structuring large volumes of information.

---

### 🏷 **Tag**

A flexible, user-defined label applied to a document or entity to support
filtering,
organization, or semantic grouping. Tags are typically optional and
non-hierarchical.

---

### 🔍 **Search Query**

A user-generated or system-generated expression used to find documents or other
entities based on specific criteria such as keywords, filters, or semantic
vectors.

---

### 🤖 **Smart Search**

An advanced semantic search feature powered by vector embeddings and
large language models (LLMs). It allows users to ask natural language
questions and receive context-aware results by understanding the meaning,
not just the keywords.

---

### 🧠 **Vector Embedding**

A numerical representation of content (e.g., text) in a multidimensional space,
used to capture semantic meaning and enable similarity-based operations like
search or recommendation.

---

### 🗄 **Storage Location**

The physical or logical destination where documents and their metadata are
stored — for example,
a file system, cloud storage, or database.

---

### 👤 **User**

An identifiable actor who interacts with the system, typically associated with
credentials
and permissions.

---

### 🛡 **Role**

A collection of responsibilities and permissions assigned to a user, defining
what actions they are authorized to perform within the system.

---

### 🔐 **Permission**

A specific rule or capability that governs access to certain operations or
resources, such as viewing, editing, or deleting a document.
