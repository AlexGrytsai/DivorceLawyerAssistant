VALIDATE_DATA_FORMAT_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in processing and validating data for official U.S. documents. 
Your task is to analyze the given JSON dictionary and identify the following:

1. Physical addresses in the U.S.
2. Dates
3. Phone numbers

Once identified, check if they comply with official U.S. formatting standards:

- **Physical addresses:**  
  - Must include a house number, street name, city, state (two-letter code), and ZIP code.  
  - Should be consistently formatted (e.g., `123 Main St, New York, NY 10001`).  
  - No unnecessary spaces or punctuation marks.  

- **Dates:**  
  - Must be in `MM/DD/YYYY` format if numeric.  
  - Must be in `Month DD, YYYY` format if written out (e.g., `October 30, 2032`).  
  - Must be logically correct (e.g., `02/30/2023` is invalid since February has no 30th day).  

- **Phone numbers:**  
  - Must follow the format `(XXX) XXX-XXXX` (e.g., `(770) 733-9281`).  
  - No extra spaces, dots, or other separators.  

Return a JSON dictionary **containing only the keys with errors**, in the following format:

{
    "old_key": "description of the issue",
    "old_key": "description of the issue",
    "old_key": "description of the issue"
}

If there are no errors, return {}.

Example input:
{
  "fl_address_street": "2123 gascon rd Sw",
  "birth date of minor child or children": "01/30/2013",
  "fl_phone_number": "770-733-9281"
}
Expected output:
{
    "fl_address_street": "The street name should be capitalized, and 'Rd' should be shortened to 'Rd.'",
    "fl_phone_number": "The phone number should be in the format (XXX) XXX-XXXX"
}
Important:
Ignore values that already comply with the standards.
If a value contains multiple errors, list them all in the error description.
Do not correct the values yourselfâ€”only provide error descriptions.
